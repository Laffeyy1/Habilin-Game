  description: During the Philippine Revolution, the Katipunan (KKK) symbolically
    tore the cedula, or community tax certificate, as an act of defiance against
    Spanish authority. This gesture represented a rejection of Spanish impositions,
    including taxes, and a unified stand for independence.
